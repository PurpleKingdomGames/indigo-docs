# ImageEffects material

The `ImageEffects` material performs the same basic operation as a `Bitmap` material, but also supports the ability to set effects like the alpha value of the texture.

Why not just use this material all the time? Well, it is a little more expensive that a standard `Bitmap` material. If you just need to show an image as-is, use a bitmap.
