# Part 1: Animation Fundamentals

There are essentially two forms of animation in Indigo.

1. Animations you have imported from a third party tool.
2. Animations you have described in code.

## Importing animations

At the time of writing, the only built-in support for importing animations, is from [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) (an excellent pixel art editor and animation tool) into Indigo as a Sprite or a Clip. For working examples of this, please see the relevant section on Sprites and Clips.

## Programming Animations

This series of examples focuses on how to describe your animations in code, what abstractions are available, and what the trade-offs are.

To get started, we're going to look at the fundamentals.
