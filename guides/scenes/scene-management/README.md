# Managing scenes

Scene's are a really handy way to organise your game into distinct 'scenes' or 'screens', such as a menu screen or a loading screen or the main game scene. The benefit is that, although they do not stop you from having full access to everything, they allow you to minify and encapsulate each screens functionality and data to keep it small and easy to reason about.
