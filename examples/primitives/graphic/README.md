# Graphic

Indigo has a number of primitives that all serve the same purpose, which is to help you tell Indigo how to fill a space on the screen.

The graphic primitive is probably the simplest, its job is to take a texture and render it. Depending on the material type you choose, you can achieve different effects, but materials apply to most primitives universally.

Graphic's special ability is that it can crop images.
