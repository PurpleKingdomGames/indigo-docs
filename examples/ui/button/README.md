# UI Components: Button

This example shows how to set up a lone button using Indigo's general UI system. The component UI system provides out of the box functionality for standard requirements like re-flowing / responsively positioned UI elements. Indigo's UI system is _not_ as clever as using something like HTML, but should satisfy many common use cases.

## A word on appearance

Indigo's UI component system is a generic UI layout system, and as such does not come with any specific rendering / look-and-feel helpers. In this example, the component's visuals will be constructed using simple primitives like shapes and text boxes, but the look and feel are only limited by what you can get Indigo to render.
