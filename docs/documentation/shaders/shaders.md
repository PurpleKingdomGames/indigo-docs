# Shaders Overview

Shaders are small c-like programs used to tell your graphics card how to render things to the screen. Indigo has various built in shaders, and fully supports custom shaders too!

There are three ways to use Shaders in Indigo:

1. Shaders written using Ultraviolet + Scala (recommended)
2. GLSL programs embedded in your game
3. GLSL programs loaded from external sources

Shaders are a vast subject that we will not cover here. The best source of information (from us), is on the [Ultraviolet documentation](https://ultraviolet.indigoengine.io/) site, where there is general shader information and lots of practical examples you can run and view. If you think any examples are missing, please feel free to raise an issue.

Additionally there are some shader examples in the Indigo docs too, under the examples section.
