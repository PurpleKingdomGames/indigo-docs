# Indigo

Indigo is a pixel art Scala 2D game engine that encourages functional programming, and broadly follows the Elm architecture.

## Notice: The documentation is undergoing renovation

Indigo's old documentation was hopelessly out of date, and we're moving to a "working example based documentation" approach.

The examples on this site currently only cover a fraction of Indigo's functionality, but they are guaranteed to be up to date and correct.

[If you'd like to help, please feel free to contributed more examples](https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/indigo-docs), built using [purpledoc](https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/purpledoc).
