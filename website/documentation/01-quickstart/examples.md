# Examples, Demos, and References

At various points in Indigo's development, little games and examples have been made. These help drive out requirements, test the feel of the engine against real examples and help ensure the build is stable.

They are not always very polished, but they are small and reasonably easy to follow.

## Examples

Examples can all be found in the [indigo-examples](https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/indigo-examples) repo.

Please visit the [repo](https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/indigo-examples) for more information.
