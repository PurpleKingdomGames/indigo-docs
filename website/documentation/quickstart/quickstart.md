# Quick start

### Using a project template

To help you get started quickly, we've put together a minimal [Giter8](https://www.foundweekends.org/giter8/) project template that supports both [Mill](https://mill-build.com/) and [SBT](https://www.scala-sbt.org/).

For up to date usage information, please visit the README file in the templates git repository:

[https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/indigo.g8](https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/indigo.g8)

## Building Indigo Games

Once you have run the template, please see the generated `README.md` file, which gives you a list of available commands to build and run your project.
