# Snake!

Snake! was the first Indigo game ever developed, in order to prove that the engine worked.

The game's implementation has somewhat evolved with the engine, but is still fairly true to the original code - which isn't necessarily a good thing! Still, it represents a far more complete implementation than the 'Snake in 5 minutes' demo, in that it has several screens, keeps score, and has a real end state.
